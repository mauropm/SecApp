SecApp

AUTHOR: Mauro Parra-Miranda <mauropm@gmail.com>
Description: An app to help create and share urban intelligence allowing 
you to create and view all kinds of issues (fire, shotgun, etc), so you 
can actually see in the screen the important event that you need to cover,
so you can actually go there in the speediest possible way. 


TODO: 

- Finishing integrating with Navicon
- Creating the ACS infrastructure to support adding/viewing sec incidents. 
- Refine the addition of issues.
